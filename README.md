## Pages

### Homepage (index.html)

- About section with feature highlights
- Gallery showcasing project artwork
- Navigation to documentation

### Documentation (documents.html)

## Interactive Elements

### Three Main Action Buttons
1. **Get Started** - Ready for your custom functionality
2. **Learn More** - Ready for your custom functionality  
3. **Join Community** - Ready for your custom functionality

Each button has placeholder functionality that can be easily customized to link to your desired destinations or trigger specific actions.

## Customization

### Adding Button Functionality
The three main buttons have event listeners in `script.js`. To customize their behavior:

1. Open `assets/js/script.js`
2. Find the button event listeners (btn-1, btn-2, btn-3)
3. Replace the placeholder alerts with your desired functionality

Example:
```javascript
const btn1 = document.getElementById('btn-1');
if (btn1) {
    btn1.addEventListener('click', function() {
        // Replace this with your custom functionality
        window.location.href = 'https://your-link-here.com';
    });
}
```

### Updating Social Media Links
Social media icons in the footer are currently placeholders. To add real links:

1. Open `index.html` and `documents.html`
2. Find the footer social links
3. Replace the `href="#"` attributes with your actual social media URLs

### Adding Content
- **White Paper**: Edit the content in `documents.html` or replace the Word document
- **Roadmap**: Update the timeline in `documents.html` or replace the Word document
- **Images**: Replace images in the `assets/images/` folder (keep the same filenames)
